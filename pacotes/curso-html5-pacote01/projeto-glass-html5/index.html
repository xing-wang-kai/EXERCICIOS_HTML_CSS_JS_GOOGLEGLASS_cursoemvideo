            <h2>What is it</h2>
            <p><strong>Google Glass</strong> is an accessory in the form of glasses that allows users to interact with various content in augmented reality. Also called <em>Project Glass</em>, the electronic device is capable of taking pictures using voice commands, sending instant messages and videoconferencing. Its launch is scheduled for 2014, and its price should be US$ 1,500. Currently, <strong>Google Glass</strong> is in the testing phase and already has a fully recorded video with the device. In addition, the search company has filed new anti-theft and screen-unlocking patents for the accessory.</p>

            <p>There is no specific and official date for the device to be released yet. It may be available in demos starting in 2013, but its release to stores is for at least 2014.</p>

            <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>According to sources close to Google, the glasses will feature a small LCD or AMOLED screen on top and in front of the wearer's eyes. With the use of a camera and GPS, you can locate yourself, as well as select options with the movement of your head.</p>

            <h1>What You Can Do With Google Glasses</h1>
            <p>Google's promotional video shows that you can transform yourself into a kind of "super<wbr>human", since the device can indicate how far you are from your destination, if the subway is open or closed, show the weather, schedule and even let you set up dates with just voice commands.</p>

           <h2>What's New in Glass</h2>
           <p>Google has finally revealed the full specifications of <strong>Google Glass</strong>, and with it a surprise still unheard of in the market: the search giant will use an audio system based on conduction transduction. Through the temples of the glasses, the sound will be transmitted to the user's ear through micro-vibrations in certain bones of his head, without using any kind of speaker.</p>

           <p>In addition to the surprise of the audio, the screen mounted in front of the user's eye also drew attention. There will be 640 x 360 pixels of resolution, which, in proportion, would be equivalent to a 25-inch high-definition monitor placed 2.5 meters away from the viewer.</p>
